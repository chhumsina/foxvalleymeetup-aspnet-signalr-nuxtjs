Building Apps with VueJS, NuxtJS, SignalR and .NET core

This repository is a quick demo of an app showcasing a variety of features related
to building apps with the technologies listed above. I built this demo for a local
meetup in my area.

[A live demo is available here](https://goodreads.mattjcowan.com/) (but I will probably be removing it after the meetup)
