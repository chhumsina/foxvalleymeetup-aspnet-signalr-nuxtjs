Building Apps with VueJS, NuxtJS, SignalR and .NET core

This repository is a quick weekend project demo of an app showcasing a variety of features
pertinent to building apps with the technologies listed above. I built this demo for a [local
meetup in my area](https://www.meetup.com/Fox-Valley-NET-Web-Development-Meetup/events/259403666/)

[A live demo is available here](https://goodreads.mattjcowan.com/) (but I will probably be removing it after the meetup)

Some other stuff:
